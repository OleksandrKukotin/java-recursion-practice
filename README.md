# Java Recursion Practice

This repository is intended for practicing recursion in Java. It includes a set of small programming tasks designed to improve your skills in using recursion. Each task is presented as a separate Java class that you can complete and submit as a commit to the repository.

## Tasks
- **Factorial**: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. ✓
- **Fibonacci**: Write a function to calculate the N-th Fibonacci number using recursion. ✓
- **Array Sum**: Write a function to find the sum of all numbers in an array using recursion. ✓
- **Digit Sum**: Write a function to calculate the sum of the digits of a number using recursion. ✓
- **String Reversal**: Write a function to reverse a string using recursion. ✓
- **Array Max**: Write a function to find the largest element in an array using recursion. ✓
- **Array Count**: Write a function to count the number of occurrences of an element in an array using recursion. ✓
- **The Greatest Common Divisor**: Write a function to find the GCD (The Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers using recursion. ✓
- **Palindrome**: Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome using recursion. ✓
- **Power**: Write a function to calculate the power of a number using recursion. ✓
- **Red-Black Tree Operations**: Implement various operations on a Red-Black Tree using recursion. Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree with the additional property of color (red or black) assigned to each node. The task involves writing recursive functions for operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and traversal on a Red-Black Tree. This task provides an opportunity to practice recursion in the context of a complex data structure and understand the principles of maintaining balance in a Red-Black Tree.
