# Java Recursion Practice

This repository is intended for practicing recursion in Java. It includes a set of small programming tasks designed to improve your skills in using recursion. Each task is presented as a separate Java class that you can complete and submit as a commit to the repository.

## Tasks
- **Factorial**: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. ✓
- **Fibonacci**: Write a function to calculate the N-th Fibonacci number using recursion. ✓
- **Array Sum**: Write a function to find the sum of all numbers in an array using recursion. ✓
- **Digit Sum**: Write a function to calculate the sum of the digits of a number using recursion. ✓
- **String Reversal**: Write a function to reverse a string using recursion.
- **Array Max**: Write a function to find the largest element in an array using recursion. ✓
- **Array Count**: Write a function to count the number of occurrences of an element in an array using recursion.
- **The Greatest Common Divisor**: Write a function to find the GCD (The Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers using recursion.
- **Palindrome**: Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- **Power**: Write a function to calculate the power of a number using recursion.
